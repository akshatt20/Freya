# Freya: Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol

## What is Freya?

Freya is an innovative cross-chain interoperability protocol that enables seamless token transfers between different super chain blockchain networks like Base, Optimism, Unichain, etc. It provides a secure and efficient way to swap and bridge tokens across multiple blockchain ecosystems, making cross-chain transactions accessible and user-friendly by utilizing AI agents.

## What does Freya do?

- **Cross-Chain Token Swaps**: Enables users to swap tokens between different super chain blockchain networks like Base, Optimism, Unichain, etc.
- **Token Bridging**: Facilitates the secure transfer of tokens from one super chain blockchain network to another
- **Automated Processing**: Uses AI agents to handle cross-chain transactions automatically
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Implements secure smart contracts with agent-only access for critical operations

## How does Freya work?

Freya operates through a sophisticated system of smart contracts and AI agents:

1. **Smart Contracts**: 
   - Deployed on multiple OP stack blockchain networks like Base, Optimism, Unichain, etc.
   - Implement `onlyAgent` modifiers for secure operations
   - Handle token minting and burning across chains
   - Deployed on the address: 0xE55A698143bbb447F09b2628aAfE04991B764067 on base-sepolia, optimism-sepolia, zora and unichain

2. **Cross-Chain Communication**:
   - Secure message passing between chains
   - Verification of cross-chain transactions
   - Atomic swaps for guaranteed transaction completion

3. **Token Management**:
   - Cross-chain minting of equivalent tokens
   - Secure burning of tokens on the source chain
   - Maintaining token supply consistency across chains

## Working of the superERC20 token contracts

The SuperETH contract is an ERC-20 token that allows users to seamlessly wrap and unwrap ETH into SuperETH (sETH) at a 1:1 ratio. Users can deposit ETH into the contract to receive an equivalent amount of sETH, which can be used for on-chain transactions or transferred across supported chains. At any time, users can redeem or withdraw sETH to reclaim their ETH.

A key feature of this contract is cross-chain functionality, facilitated by an AI agent (a wallet with the same address on multiple chains). This agent is the only entity authorized to call crosschainMint and crosschainBurn, ensuring that SuperETH is only minted on the destination chain after an equivalent amount has been burned on the source chain. This approach eliminates reliance on third-party bridges, reducing costs, improving security, and enabling trustless, decentralized multi-chain ETH transfers.

## AI Agents Implementation

Freya utilizes AI agents as trusted intermediaries for cross-chain operations:

1. **Agent Responsibilities**:
   - Execute cross-chain mint functions
   - Handle token burning operations
   - Verify transaction validity
   - Monitor network status

2. **Security Features**:
   - `onlyAgent` modifier ensures only authorized agents can execute critical functions
   - AI-powered validation of transactions
   - Automated security checks and balances

### Key Components:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Modern React-based UI
   - Web3 integration
   - Cross-chain transaction interface

2. **Backend**:
   - Agent management system
   - Smart contract interaction layer
   - Cross-chain communication handlers

3. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Token management contracts
   - Bridge contracts
   - Security and access control

## Future Goals
